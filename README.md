# Recipe-book-app

An Angular app that manages recipes and a shopping list where you can add the ingredients from the recipes you want. The app uses Firebase for a fake REST server and deployment. <br>

-Angular basics, Angular routing and making HTTP requests<br>
-TypeScript basics<br>
-Observables<br>

The app is hosted on firebase, so you can access the app by clicking this link: https://ng-course-recipe-book-f2fe5.web.app
